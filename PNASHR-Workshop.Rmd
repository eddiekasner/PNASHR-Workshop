    - Please add (via GitHub or email), especially for:
        - Forestry
        - Fishing
        - Oregon
        - Idaho
        - Alaska

## Data analysis
1. Develop collaborative code development tools (Github?)

3. Develop functions and tools that can be generalized and shared

## Hands-on workshop

1. Exercise 1: Introduction to R and RStudio
    - Option 1: Use the DEOHS maintained RShiny server
        - https://rstudio.sph.washington.edu/  
    - Option 2: Install R and RShiny onto your personal computer
2. Exercise 2: Flexible Dashboard
    - https://github.com/elaustin/Ag-Health-Indicators/blob/master/Injury%20Data%20WA/flexdash_injury.Rmd

## Workshop

* What R is (and isn't)
* Why R is so popular
* What RStudio is and isn't
* Reasons to use RStudio
* How to use RStudio

## What is R?

* R is a cross-platform software **_application_** for data analysis and visualization
* R is **_free_** to use, **_free_** to share, and **_free_** to modify
* R is a programming **_language_** with over 10,000 user-contributed packages
* R is an open source and **_community_**-driven software development **_project_**

## What R isn't

* R is not a point-and-click software application (though some are available for R)
* R is not a proprietary commercial product (though some do sell it)
* R is not something you can master in a day (or a week, or a month)

## Why R is so popular

* It is free
* Support from a very helpful community of thousands of users
* Available code or packages which are only available in R
* Ability to generate quality graphics for publication
* Supports data analysis "best practices"
* End-to-end solution for reproducible data analysis
* Capable of handling "Big Data"

## What RStudio is and isn't

### RStudio is:

* A full-featured, cross-platform, open source application for working with R
* A graphical user interface (GUI) for working with R

### RStudio isn't:

* A point-and-click spreadsheet app (like Excel)
* A point-and-click plotting app (like Tableau)
* A text-only command-line utility (but it includes a text Console)
* An R language interpreter (as R is installed as a separate app)

## Why use RStudio?

* It is a user-friendly way to use R
    - The interface feels familiar to many people  
    - Integrates common data analysis workflows
* You can use it for free on most computer systems
* It is very popular, so your collaborators may already be using it
* Very few alternatives (R-GUI, JGR, Visual Studio) are as full-featured
* It performs well, is designed well, and is backed by a respected company

We are going to gear our instruction towards the use of RStudio and will not 
be covering the other alternatives.

## Ways to use RStudio

### RStudio Server accessed through a web browser

* Easier to learn and teach on because it's centrally managed by IT.
* SPH runs an RStudio Server on "rstudio.sph" for use by all UW SPH departments.
   - Link: [https://rstudio.sph.washington.edu](https://rstudio.sph.washington.edu)
   - Free for SPH affiliates (students, staff, faculty, postdocs, etc.) to use. 
   - Requires UW NetID.
* DEOHS runs an RStudio Server on "Plasmid" for use by DEOHS.
   - Link: [https://plasmid.deohs.washington.edu](https://plasmid.deohs.washington.edu)
   - Free for DEOHS affiliates (students, staff, faculty, postdocs, etc.) to use. 
   - Requires UW NetID and DEOHS account.
   - Access directly from UW Campus or remotely through [Husky OnNet VPN](https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/uw-networks/about-husky-onnet/).
   - Easily access your departmental storage (i.e., network "drives").
* This "onramp" is geared towards using RStudio Server, but any RStudio will work.

## Ways to use RStudio

### RStudio Cloud

[Rstudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) is a internet-based option to run Rstudio: [https://rstudio.cloud/](https://rstudio.cloud/). 

Eliminates hardware and software configuration and management required when running R & RStudio locally.

Requires

* Internet connection & browser
* Account sign-up

Free for individual use with some restrictions (e.g. number of projects, memory), 
and has paid subscription upgrade.

## Ways to use RStudio

### Download and run locally

* The RStudio Desktop application is available for free on the [internet](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
* We will not focus on local installation or use during this introductory onramp,
but some instructions are at the end of this presentation.

## How to install R and RStudio Desktop

We will not be spending time on local installations of R and RStudio during this introductory onramp. These instructions are here for reference if needed:

1. [Download](https://cran.r-project.org/banner.shtml) the latest
   **_installer_** version of **_R_** available for your operating system.
     - Run the installer (usually by double-clicking on the installer's icon).
     - Click through the installer's prompts accordingly. The defaults are       
       usually fine.
2. [Download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) the latest
   **_installer_** version of **_RStudio Desktop_** available for your 
   operating system.
     - Run the installer (usually by double-clicking on the installer's icon).
     - Click through the installer's prompts accordingly. The defaults are       
       usually fine.
3. You may remove the installers when you have confirmed that RStudio is 
   installed correctly and launches without error.
